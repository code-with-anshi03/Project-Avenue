# Project-Avenue

ABOUT THE PROJECT - Avenue is a beginner-friendly programming language and transpiler designed to make programming and DSA concepts accessible to beginners. The goal is to provide a language that is easy to read and write, inspired by Python syntax, but with the performance and structure of C/C++. It supports basic commands like print() and scan(), along with arrays, strings, and pointers. Avenue also auto-generates helpful comments to guide learners, making the coding experience less intimidating. The project is intended to grow into a full-fledged language with compiler support, object-oriented programming features, and AI-assisted suggestions in the future.

TEAM MEMBERS - The Avenue project is a collaborative effort, with clearly defined roles for each member. Anshika Singh focuses on the C/C++ backend and core logic of the language. Shradha Jain is responsible for the compiler, lexer, and parser development, ensuring that Avenue’s syntax translates correctly into executable code. Sarvagya Chaturvedi works on the Python interface and integration, enabling easy interaction between different parts of the project. Together, the team is building Avenue as a beginner-friendly platform that bridges learning and practical programming.

CURRENT FEATURES - Currently, Avenue supports essential commands like print() and scan() and has functionality for arrays and strings. The language has a beginner-friendly syntax and automatically generates comments to guide learners through their code. These features aim to reduce the steep learning curve for beginners and provide a smooth transition into more advanced programming concepts.

PLANNED FEATURES - In the future, Avenue aims to expand into a full programming language with complete compiler support. Object-oriented programming concepts will be implemented, along with AI-assisted suggestions to help beginners write better code. The project also plans to integrate with beginner-friendly IDEs to create a seamless coding experience. As the language matures, it will continue to focus on accessibility and education for new programmers.

HOW TO CONTRIBUTE - Contributions to Avenue are welcome. Team members and external collaborators can fork the repository, create a feature branch, make changes, and submit pull requests. Each pull request can be reviewed before merging into the main branch. This workflow ensures smooth collaboration, maintains code quality, and helps the project grow in a structured and organized manner.
